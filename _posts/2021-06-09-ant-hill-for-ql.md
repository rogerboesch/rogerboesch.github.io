## 🕹️ Ant Hill - Greay SuperBasic game for the Sinclair QL!

![Ant Hill](/images/ant-hill.gif)

Ant Hill is originally from the book **QL GAMESMASTER**
It's a simple but effective program that involes the animation of a number of objects. 
The basic idea is to guide a man through the tunnels of a ant colony with the aim
of reach and destroy the nest of eggs.

This game shows that SuperBasic is with the help of little assembler able to create some
nice, well structured games and programs that even make a lot of fun. Enjoy!


# Type-In programs in 2021?
 
The Classics Coder App brings this experience back to 2020. Of course this time with **much more comfort** than it was in the past.
I will "type-in" by myself on a regulary basis some BASIC or assembler games and apps from the 100's of retro magazines and books I have in my collection.
 
> Type-In? Not really...
 
The Classics Coder App contains some **super cool features** to remove the pain and improve the fun for type-in programs:
 
- Automatic **scan** and **detection** of printed source code listings (**supported by machine learning**, will improve over time)
- **Syntax highlight** in editor to simplify the learning of the commands
- **Automatic error detection** and marking (as in a modern IDE)
- **Test your code** immediately in the emulator
 
**So enjoy the Type-in Listing #1 for the QL!**
