## ðŸ‘“ Magic Leap One - Voxel Engine PoC

This project showcases an early-stage voxel engine, written entirely in C++, designed to push the boundaries of immersive 3D rendering on spatial computing platforms. The demo demonstrates the successful rendering of millions of cubes on a Magic Leap One, achieving a high level of performance and visual fidelity while maintaining real-time interactivity.

### Project Overview

**Engine Design and Performance**

The voxel engine is built from the ground up in C++, leveraging its performance capabilities to handle vast amounts of data with minimal overhead. Special attention has been given to memory management and rendering pipelines to enable the smooth handling of millions of individual voxel cubes.

**Real-Time Rendering on Magic Leap One**

The demo is specifically optimized for the Magic Leap One, taking full advantage of its spatial computing features, including real-time tracking and immersive visualization. Despite the computational complexity of rendering voxel-based environments, the engine achieves stable frame rates, highlighting its potential for larger-scale applications.

**Procedural and Manual Voxel Generation**

The engine supports both procedurally generated voxel landscapes and manually designed structures, allowing for a versatile range of use cases. Whether creating infinite worlds or hand-crafting detailed environments, the underlying system ensures efficient rendering and manipulation.


### Technical Highlights

**Efficient Data Structures**

Custom data structures are employed to optimize the storage and traversal of voxel data, reducing the memory footprint and improving rendering speeds.

**Dynamic Level of Detail (LOD)**

The engine dynamically adjusts the level of detail based on the viewerâ€™s position and perspective, ensuring a balance between performance and visual quality.

**Custom Shaders and Rendering Pipelines**

The rendering process is powered by custom shaders, designed to optimize the appearance of millions of cubes. Advanced spatial effects enhance the overall immersion.
