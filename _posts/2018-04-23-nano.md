## üïπÔ∏è Nano - A RTS Shooter

This project showcases a prototype for a procedurally generated real-time strategy (RTS) game world, crafted in a visually appealing low-poly art style. The aim is to demonstrate the integration of procedural generation techniques with core RTS mechanics, creating a dynamic and visually unique gaming experience for each playthrough.

### Core Features

**Procedural Terrain Generation**

The terrain is dynamically created using algorithms to ensure a diverse layout of mountains, forests, rivers, and plains. Each new world presents players with fresh strategic opportunities and challenges. The terrain is optimized for gameplay with clear pathways for units and logical resource placement.

**Resource Distribution**

Key resources such as minerals, wood, and water are procedurally scattered across the map. Their placement is balanced to encourage exploration and strategic expansion while maintaining fairness for all players.

**Dynamic Low Poly Aesthetics**

The world is rendered in a charming low-poly style, offering a blend of simplicity and clarity. The visual style not only aligns with modern indie trends but also enhances performance, making the prototype accessible on a wide range of devices.

**AI Opponent Integration**

Basic AI logic is included to challenge players. The AI adapts to the generated terrain, making tactical decisions based on available resources and chokepoints.

**Technical Highlights**

**Terrain Algorithms**

Uses Perlin noise and Voronoi diagrams to generate natural-looking landscapes with diverse topographies. Biome blending ensures smooth transitions between different terrain types.

**Scalability**

The generation system supports maps of various sizes, from compact battlefields to sprawling worlds suitable for extended campaigns.

**Performance Optimization**

Efficient algorithms and level-of-detail (LOD) management are employed to ensure smooth gameplay, even on lower-end hardware.
