## üïπÔ∏è Vectrex Emulator in Unity

How fast is Unity 3d really when it's about Scripting?
I had a bet with one of my former working colleagues, that it's not possible to write a full working emulator in Unity 3D, just with C# Scripting. As you see it is :) It's not just rendering, it's full emulation of the Motorola 6809 cpu and GI 8910 multi-i/o chip, all in C#.
Up to 10 emulators at the same time are working right now without further optimisations.
