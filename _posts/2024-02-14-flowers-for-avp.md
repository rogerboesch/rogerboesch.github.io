## ðŸ‘“ Apple Vision Pro - Valentine's App :)

First of all, this is **NOT** a prototype app. It's an iOS project from 8 years ago I ported over to the AVP in 2 hours at the weekend to understand how everything works on the AVP from a developer's perspective and to get a sense of the performance and limitations.

The App itself is, therefore, not so important, but since it's somehow related to Valentine's Day, I decided to post it anyway ;)

Technologies used: SwiftUI, RealityKit, Metal, Swift, Objective-C, C/C++

(It's also quite challenging to show the real rendering quality in a video)
