## 🕹️ Tennis - BASIC Type-In Listing #4

*from Happy Computer Octrober, 1984*

This pseudo 3D program offers an interesting tennis match against the ZX Spectrum.

# Type-In programs in 2021?
 
The Classics Coder App brings this experience back to 2020. Of course this time with **much more comfort** than it was in the past.
I will "type-in" by myself on a regulary basis some BASIC or assembler games and apps from the 100's of retro magazines and books I have in my collection.
 
> Type-In? Not really...
 
The Classics Coder App contains some **super cool features** to remove the pain and improve the fun for type-in programs:
 
- Automatic **scan** and **detection** of printed source code listings (**supported by machine learning**, will improve over time)
- **Syntax highlight** in editor to simplify the learning of the commands
- **Automatic error detection** and marking (as in a modern IDE)
- Tape loading simulation to **test your code** immediately in the emulator
 
**So enjoy the Type-in Listing #4!**
