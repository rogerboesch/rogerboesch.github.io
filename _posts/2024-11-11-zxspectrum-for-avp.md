## ðŸ‘“ A ZX Emulator for the Apple Vision Pro

A little XR fun project for the weekend:
Have you ever wondered what running a ZX Spectrum emulator on an XR headset is like? In this video, I showcase how to bring the retro magic of the ZX Spectrum to a mixed-reality headset. Whether you're a retro enthusiast or just curious about what's possible with AR, join me as I bring nostalgia to the next-gen platform.
This is a prototype and proof of concept for bridging C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift. The next phase is integrating hand tracking instead of a Kempston Joystick.
