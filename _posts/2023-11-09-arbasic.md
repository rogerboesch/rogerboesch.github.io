## ðŸ‘“ XR BASIC - Retro Coding on XR

It finally works :) A side project I'm worked on for a while. Just take a keyboard and some AR glasses and start to learn BASIC, like it was in the 80s.

Why BASIC?
It's fun and easy to learn, also for children's

*Why Retro Computing?*
Easily understand the concepts behind computers, the technology, and how all works.

*Why Augmented Reality?*
No need for fragile hardware and many different systems at a fingertip, and all in 3D
