## 🕹️ Spectrum Invaders - BASIC Type-In Listing #2

*from the Spectrum Book of games*
Two types of alien ships are heading towards earth and you have to defend civilisation as we know it.


**How to play:**

You can move your missile launcher to left and right using the '5' and '8' keys. Press the key '7' to fire a missile. You score points for every alien you hit, the ones further away from you counting for more points than the nearer ones. The game is over when you have destroyed all the invaders or when the nearest remaining ones reach the line.


# Type-In programs in 2020?
 
The Classics Coder App brings this experience back to 2020. Of course this time with **much more comfort** than it was in the past.
I will "type-in" by myself on a weekly basis some BASIC or assembler games and apps from the 100's of retro magazines and books I have in my collection.
 
> Type-In? Not really...
 
The Classics Coder App contains some **super cool features** to remove the pain and improve the fun for type-in programs:
 
- Automatic **scan** and **detection** of printed source code listings (**supported by machine learning**, will improve over time)
- **Syntax highlight** in editor to simplify the learning of the commands
- **Automatic error detection** and marking (as in a modern IDE)
- Tape loading simulation to **test your code** immediately in the emulator
 
**So enjoy the Type-in Listing #2!**
